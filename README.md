# Dundee Web App Builder Widgets
In Dundee we use [ArcGIS Web App Builder](https://developers.arcgis.com/web-appbuilder/) for some of our corporate GIS applications.  
Where we can share our custom widgets/plugins we'll put them here for others to use - if you do find them useful please let us know. 

Forks, Issues and Pull Requests welcome. 

## Widgets

* Add Map Layers to Map _Under Development_

Our GIS users organise layers into thematic groups by saving them in maps, this tool will allow users to add operational layers from a map into the current map.
